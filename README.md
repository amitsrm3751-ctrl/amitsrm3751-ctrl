✨ Hi, I'm Amitabh Gogoi
Senior Manager – Credit Risk | Credit Analysis | Risk Modelling | Analytics

I’m a banking and risk professional with 12+ years of experience across credit analysis, credit risk, financial analysis, operational risk, and the full lending lifecycle. My expertise includes credit appraisal, security valuation, working capital assessment, collections, recovery, and NPA resolution (SARFAESI/DRT, OTS, negotiated settlements).

Currently, I work in Operational Risk, managing key functions within a ₹1300 crore currency chest, including RBI regulatory reporting, RCSA/KRI frameworks, and internal risk controls. I also support tech initiatives through UAT testing for Finacle, loan systems, and RBI’s e-Kuber portal, along with preparing RFPs and vendor onboarding.

Alongside my banking experience, I’m building a GitHub portfolio focused on practical credit risk analysis, Python-based modelling, and data-driven insights.
